## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. OpenCV library
3. Installing
4. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/rahulrajpv/optical_flow.git

5. Install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python

## Usage
1. Open the optical_flow.py script with a text editor.
2. Change the video_path variable to the path of the video file you want to use.
3. Run the script:
python optical_flow.py
4. The output window will display the optical flow of the video.

# Video Background Changer
This is a Python script that demonstrates how to remove the background of a video and replace it with a new image using OpenCV.
